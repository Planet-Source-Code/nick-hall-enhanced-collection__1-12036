## Enhanced Collection


</div>

### Description

This code provides an enhanced version of the Collection class provided by VB.

Features include:

- Search/Sort capabilities, including support for a callback interface in your classes which allows customisation of this feature;

- Update an item in-place, as well as move it within the collection with a single method call;

- Fully persistable. You can save the contents of the collection to a PropertyBag or direct to disk;

- Implements the existing Collection interface so it can be used interchangeably with the standard VB Collection;

- Provides a second collection based on Strings instead of Variants;

- And loads more!

UPDATE 23 Oct 2000 - Fixed minor bug in Add method (occured when using a Before or After Index that didn't exist)
